This repository is for Nolan, Cole, Tyler, and Spencer's lab group in our Astro 121 (Radio Laboratory) class. It will host any data we collect.

Our first commit was on 01/22/22, consisting of a csv file (to be read as a pandas dataframe) containing a number of data points read in by the ugradio.sdr.capture_data_direct function for a variety of function generator and sampling frequencies.
