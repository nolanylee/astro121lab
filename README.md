# Astro 121 Lab

Group for UC Berkeley Astro 121 lab consisting of Cole, Julia, Nolan, Tyler, and Spencer. 
This repository contains data and analysis files for our four lab experiments done in spring semester of 2022.
Note: lab 4 does not include data since data files were too large to upload to Github.
