This repository is for Nolan, Cole, Tyler, and Spencer's lab group for their Astro 121 (Radio Laboratory) class.

Our first commit was on 01/22/22, consisting of a csv file (to be read as a pandas dataframe) containing a number of data points read in
by the ugradio.sdr.capture_data_direct function for a variety of function generator and sampling frequencies.
