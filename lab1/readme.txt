This repository is for Nolan, Cole, Tyler, and Spencer's lab group in our Astro 121 (Radio Laboratory) class. It will host any data we collect.

Our first commit was on 01/22/22, consisting of a csv file (to be read as a pandas dataframe) containing a number of data points read in by the ugradio.sdr.capture_data_direct function for a variety of function generator and sampling frequencies.

From 01/22-01/28, we added more data with the help of Christian, and eventually managed to obtain our own nice data using the 10 dB attenuator to reduce the amplitude. We also generated several plots for the sine waves and fourier transforms.
